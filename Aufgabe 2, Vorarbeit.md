The evaluation of our data via linear regression is analogue to exercise 2. Our results can be found in the table below

In this case we find 2 exact fits, the first and third one. This means we get an exact fit determined through our theory. Nonetheless we have to keep in mind our high $\sigma_{s}$ that probably distorted our measuerement. The second and fourth measurement are also not the best, with a clear systematic of our residuals. Every errorbar of the second measurement crosses the zero line, 8/10 cross it for the fourth measurement. We get a similar quality of our regressions as in exercise 2. Yet again
